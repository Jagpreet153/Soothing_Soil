As a beginner in web development, I'm excited to share my latest project with you all! I've created a website that allows users to learn about the soil found in different states of India.

By simply entering the name of a state, users can access information about the soil type, pH levels, and other key characteristics. This website is a great resource for students, researchers, and anyone who's interested in learning more about the world around us.

Building this website was a challenge, but I learned so much along the way. From HTML and CSS to JavaScript and API integrations, I had the opportunity to hone my skills as a web developer and explore new technologies.

I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far, and I can't wait to see what other projects I'll create in the future. If you're interested in checking out my website, you can find it here https://jagpreet153.github.io/Soothing_Soil/.
